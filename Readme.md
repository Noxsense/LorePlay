## EsoUI Addon : Modified Version of LorePlay

This is a modified version of Justinon's LorePlay add-on, distributed under the Artistic License 2.0 as same as the standard version.
See the description of the standard version below for general LorePlay features.

### Needed libraries/dependencies:
YOU NEED TO INSTALL THE FOLLOWING LIBRARY SEPARATELY. 
- [LibAddonMenu](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info7-LibAddonMenu.html) : by sirinsidiator and Seerah

### Modification details:
- Forked from Justinon's standard version 1.5.1
- Removed embedded LibStub and LibAddonMenu-2.0 libraries, you now need to have LibAddonMenu-2.0 separately.
- LoreWare now support for three non-English language modes: DE, FR, and JP
- **[COMPATIBILITY-BREAKING CHANGE]**  
  The various zone and city recognitions have been rewritten to a brand-new identifier based approach by Calamath, and are no longer language mode dependent.
  As the result, the boundaries of whether the add-on recognizes cities may be slightly different from the standard version.

### Instruction for beta tester
- Thank you for your cooperation.
- If you want to run this modified version, you'll need to replace the standard version of LorePlay by Justinon. 
  Therefore, it is strongly recommended that you use minion to create a backup with save data, or save the backup manually. 

### Comments from the author:
I think Justinon's originality Lore Play has some cool ideas. One of my favorite is a location-based event-driven. 
That's why I was disappointed that some features of the current standard version didn't work well in non-English modes.
This modified version focuses especifically on making it work well in the non-English modes.
Therefore, if you are playing ESO in English mode, you don't need to switch to this version.

### DISCLAIMER:
With the current game specs, it is not easy for the Eso UI to recognize if your avatar is in a city or not, unlike the players themselves.
Also, this type of processing will need to be updated every time they introduce a new area by the future DLCs or Chapters.
I'm not responsible for any future maintenances. But it's better than leaving it buried this cool add-on.
