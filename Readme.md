### Needed libraries/dependencies:
YOU NEED TO INSTALL THE FOLLOWING LIBRARY SEPARATELY. 
- [LibAddonMenu](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info7-LibAddonMenu.html) : by sirinsidiator and Seerah

### Modification details:
- Forked from Justinon's standard version 1.5.1
- Removed embedded LibStub and LibAddonMenu-2.0 libraries, you now need to have LibAddonMenu-2.0 separately.
- Major Revamp of LoreWear Feature
- LoreWear now support for five non-English language modes: DE, FR, JP, RU and ES
- Support for following DLCs and Chapters: Clockwork City, Summerset, Murkmire, Elsweyr, Dragonhold, Greymoor, Markarth, Blackwood, Deadlands, and High Isle.

- **[COMPATIBILITY-BREAKING CHANGE]**  
  The various zone and city recognitions have been rewritten to a brand-new identifier based approach by Calamath, and are no longer language mode dependent.
  As the result, the boundaries of whether the add-on recognizes cities may be slightly different from the standard version.


### [LoreWear 2.0]
  * Complete transition to Calamath's new outfit change algorithm.
  * Five optional outfit preset slots with versatility, in addition to the existing four basic slots.
  * Option to register as an alternative preset for your favorite outfits.
  * New shortcut key to switch today's prefered clothes from your multiple outfit presets.
  * Optional support for changing costumes according to riding, fighting and swimming.
  * Support for outfit system introduced by Dragonbone DLC.

### Instruction:
- If you want to run this modified version, you'll need to replace the standard version of LorePlay by Justinon. 
  Therefore, it is strongly recommended that you use minion to create a backup with save data, or save the backup manually. 

### Comments from the author:
I think Justinon's originality Lore Play has some cool ideas. One of my favorite is a location-based event-driven. 
That's why I was disappointed that some features of the current standard version didn't work well in non-English modes.

### DISCLAIMER:
With the current game specs, it is not easy for the Eso UI to recognize if your avatar is in a city or not, unlike the players themselves.
Also, this type of processing will need to be updated every time they introduce a new area by the future DLCs or Chapters.
I'm not responsible for any future maintenances. But it's better than leaving it buried this cool add-on.
