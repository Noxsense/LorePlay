Comments from the author:
I think Justinon's originality Lore Play has some cool ideas, especially location-based event-driven. 
That's why I was disappointed that some features of the current standard version didn't work well in non-English modes. You too, right?

This modified version focuses specifically on making it work well in the non-English modes.
Therefore, if you are playing ESO in English mode, you don't need to switch to this version.
